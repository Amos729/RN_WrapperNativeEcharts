# RN_WrapperNativeEcharts

`RN_WrapperNativeEcharts` is designed to extract useful components for project. Later on, you can use it by dragging it into your react native project without `import` from `native-echarts` on `node_modules`. Then, there is no need to modify the content of `echarts` frequently after `npm install` each time. It's really highly customizable by yourself.

`native-echarts` link on `github`: [native-echarts](https://github.com/somonus/react-native-echarts). Unfortunately, no one seems to maintain it now.
